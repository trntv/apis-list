The team has developed a unique technology to achieve a higher level of accuracy and correction in French than the models created by English-speaking actors. Lettria aims to bring the processing of the French language as close as possible to human functioning by creating APIs based on French semantics and not on keywords.  The Lettria team combines its scientific and technological skills with linguist profiles in order to deal as closely as possible with the specificities of the French language. They aim to make the use of NLP technologies accessible by offering high-performance proprietary libraries, high-quality educational content and demonstrating the benefits of using a 100% French model in all sectors of activity
