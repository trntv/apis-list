# Creative Commons Catalog

The Creative Commons Catalog API ('cccatalog-api') is a system that allows programmatic access to public domain digital media. It is our ambition to index and catalog billions of Creative Commons works, including articles, songs, videos, photographs, paintings, and more. Using this API, developers will be able to access the digital commons in their own applications.
