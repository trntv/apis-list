LETTRIA est un outil de traitement du langage naturel (NLP) dédié à la compréhension du français. Notre mission est d'aider les développeurs à construire les prochaines applications linguistiques intelligentes, qu'il s'agisse d'un chatbot, d'un outil de traduction, de l'analyse de texte ou d'un assistant personnel. LETTRIA is one of the most advanced players in NLP (Natural Language Processing) in the French-speaking market.  The team has developed a unique technology to achieve a higher level of accuracy and correction in French than the models created by English-speaking actors. Lettria aims to bring the processing of the French language as close as possible to human functioning by creating APIs based on French semantics and not on keywords.  The Lettria team combines its scientific and technological skills with linguist profiles in order to deal as closely as possible with the specificities of the French language. They aim to make the use of NLP technologies accessible by offering high-performance proprietary libraries, high-quality educational content and demonstrating the benefits of using a 100% French model in all sectors of activity
